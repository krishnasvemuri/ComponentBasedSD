Krishna Sindhuri Vemuri G01024066 SWE645 HW5 Read me file

This project contains two War files. One for the Server and the other for the Client implementation.

I could not implement the project on the EC2, so just submitting tis project that works files on the local machine. 

The Vemuri_Server implements the search as a Web Service. And the client server consumes the Search implementation .


To run the project:

1. Unzip the files Vemuri_Server and Vemuri_Client
2. Export  Vemuri_Server and Vemuri_Client files onto Eclipse 
3. Export the source files and all other required files into elipse
4. Add external jar files required for JSF 2.2,Restful Services, Hibernate and MySQLconnector,JAXWS etc.
5. Click RunAs and run it on Tomcat 7.0 server



The link to the WSDL file is given on the search page of the client service(Vemuri_Client)
